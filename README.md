# crtAlphaMELTS
A handy script converts alphaMELTS output to formatted spreadsheet

currently only supports isobaric runs, with olivine, sp, two cpx, two feldspar, rhm, and wht on the crystallzation assemblages. Drop issues or [contact me](yishen.zhang@kuleuven.be)  if there is a need to update to different conditions and phases.

call the script with command line in your terminal:

```python
python crtAlphaMELT.py
```

or any IDEs
